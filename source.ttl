A magnetic field combined to the electromagnetic wave allows the creation of plasma at low pressure due to Electron Cyclotron Resonance. AURA-WAVE microwave plasma source has been designed to sustain microwave plasma over several decades of pressure, i.e. from 10⁻⁴ mbar to a few 10⁻² mbar and from a few watts depending on the gas.

Equally, the coaxial plasma source was designed to avoid inside power-losses and has proved to be matched, i.e. no reflected power with no additional impedance matching system over 2 to 3 pressure decades, depending on the plasma gas. Plasma density up to a few 10¹¹ cm⁻³ could be easily obtained in multisource configuration in different gases like argon, oxygen, nitrogen. When combined with SAIREM solid state microwave generator, it is possible to control the power transmitted to the plasma Watt by Watt. Low mismatching that may appear in the operating conditions can be balanced due to the variable frequency of the solid-state generator and thus permits to extend the operating condition range of AURA-WAVE.

AURA-WAVE is designed to be used equally in R&D laboratories and industry for a very large range of applications. It is ideal for working in the low-pressure range i.e. with high energy particles."""@en ;

The innovative double helix electrode design enables extremely stable and homogeneous plasma conditions at low gas flow rates. This plays a crucial role for the quality and reproducibility of several applications, e.g. PECVD of SiO₂ with a large footprint diameter or plasma microprinting of polymeric profiles (e.g. polyamide)."@en ;

An additional “extraction” electrode is arranged in parallel to form a rectangular ventilation duct. The extraction electrode is charged, so that an additional unipolar electric field through the ventilation duct is created. This drags the ions of one polarity (either positive or negative) generated by the surface DBD in the direction of the extraction electrode. These accelerated ions collide with neutral molecules and particles to form an “ion wind”. In this way, the Ion Wind DBD can remove particles, aerosols or microorganisms from an air stream (similar to an electro filter). Besides that, reactive chemical species generated by the surface DBD can more effectively enter the air volume above thereby enhancing the plasma chemical effectivity.

The Ion Wind DBD has proven decontamination, disinfection and odor reduction capabilities in high volumetric flow air streams. Usually, an active carbon filter placed downstream to the plasma source traps chemical pollutants, which get further degraded by plasma generated species. The filter also removes the unreacted ozone."""@en ;

Plasma technology is used everywhere where quality, productivity, environmental sustainability, precision and flexibility is important. Surfaces are cleaned, activated and decontaminated at atmospheric pressure with the handy kINPen® IND. The device is particularly used for surface treatment of temperature-sensitive materials as, for instance, plastics. In addition, kINPen® IND provides you an easy access to geometric challenging surfaces such as narrow clefts, capillaries or subtlest bores. The kINPen® IND base model is argon-powered. The admixture of reducing or oxidizing gases can be done up to the percentage range. Furthermore, the device is convertible through the simple change of its electrode head to operate with molecular gases like air or nitrogen.

Small molecular gas admixtures or organic vapors can be added to the carrier gas. Two outer ring electrodes (width 5 mm, distance 5 mm) are adjusted concentrically with the capillary axis. Filaments in different configurations are generated in the active plasma region between both electrodes. The applied power ranges from 4 to 20 W. An inner capillary can be used to inject a precursor into the effluent."@en ;

It has a tube-like character, is flexible, very thin and generates a biologically active jet plasma at the gas outlet. The device consists of an inner plastic tube, a ceramic nozzle, an outer plastic tube and a metal wire. The inner plastic tube is plugged upon the thin end of the ceramic nozzle. In order to provide high voltage at the end of the tube and at the same time maintain tube flexibility the metal wire is coiled around the inner tube. The outer plastic tube is placed coaxially over the inner tube. Thus, two gas channels are created. Through the inner tube helium or neon feed gas is provided with moderate flow rates of up to 300 sccm. The resulting gap between the inner and the outer tube is used to bring a second gas (CO₂) to the gas nozzle that acts as shielding gas. Due to the use of feed and shielding gas a stable plasma jet is generated even in hollow bodies. The original development was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the grant numbers: 13GW0052C and 03Z22DN12.

Due to the small dimensions, the high flexibility and the capability to work in cavities and hollow bodies, the system has subsequently been adapted to further areas of application, such as the inactivation of viruses in the upper respiratory tract."""@en ;

In the Venturi-DBD (VDBD), the pressure can be set to any value between 100 mbar and 1000 mbar reliably and reproducibly. Using a Venturi pump for vacuum generation ensures that the system is affordable and almost maintenance-free. With air as process gas, the output gas composition can seamlessly be adjusted from a strongly ozone-dominated regime to a nitrogen oxides-only-regime including nitric oxide. Moreover, an extension to a Venturi-Vapor-DBD (VVDBD) allows treating humidified process gases for an even greater plasma-chemical flexibility.

The system is available in different implementations adapted to the requirements of a variety of laboratory applications and experiments. It has been investigated in DFG research project 368502453."""@en ;
